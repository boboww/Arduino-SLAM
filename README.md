# Arduino SLAM
Movement, edge detection, SLAM, and path planning

## Robot Basics
Learn how to use the robot hardware

## Kinematics
Learn how to implement a software library and use it to move the robot along different paths

## Distance Sensor
How to use the sensors in a correct manner

## Proportional Control
Perform close loop control using distance sensors and robot motor actuators

## Wall Following
Make the robot move around a wall while keeping a distance of 5 inches from the wall to the side

## Line Detection
Implement an algorithm to detect colored lines in the floor

## Maze navigation
Implement an algorithm to navigate within a maze

## Localization and Path Planning
Implement an algorithm to find a path from a start location to the goal

## Come on and SLAM, and welcome to the jam
