Sensor raw data range is from 0 - 1023 from 0V - 5V
204.6 per 1 volt

**Remember to cast values when multiplying**

Voltage range for Short Distance Sensor is 0.4V - 2.8V 
Value ranges from 81.84 - 572.88 (actual will be 81 - 572 as output values are ints)
Distance ranges from 4  30cm (1.575-11.811 inches)

Voltage range for Long Distance Sensor is  0.4V - 2.6V 
Value ranges from 81.84 - 531.96 (actual will be 81 - 531 as output values are ints)
Distance ranges from 20 - 150cm (7.874 - 59.0551 inches)

Now use the datasheet graphs to map from voltage to distance in 1 inch increments

It takes about 100 microseconds (0.0001 s) to read an analog input, so the maximum reading rate is about 10,000 times a second.
