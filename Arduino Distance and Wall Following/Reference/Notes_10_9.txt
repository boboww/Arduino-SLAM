Proportional Control and Wall Following
error = d - t
d = distance to wall
t = 5 inch
setSpeedIPS(constant * error, constant * error)
Robot should always move back to 5 inches. Don't use interval (4.5 < d < 5.5)

saturation function caps the max IPS speed (say IPS max is 6 inches/s, so make all values above that 6in/s)

Can use any algorithm to do wall following
v = f(front sensor)
w = f(side sensor)

Algorithm basics
1. Use right and front short sensors
4. while wallDistance(), if front <200 readings (greater than 5 inches from wall) the bot should keep moving straight.
5. else if front s>200 readings (less than 5 inches from wall) it should then turn left.
2. while bot runs wallDistance(), keep right short sensor polling. 
3. Keep bot 5 inches away from wall at all times (Interval around 190-210?). (May need smoothing when bot reaches corners)
